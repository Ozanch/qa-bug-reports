# 🧠 Usability Feedback – Notion Web App

- The editor interface is clean and responsive.
- The “/” command is powerful, but new users might miss it without a tooltip or prompt.
- Dragging blocks is smooth, but the handle icon only appears on hover — it could be more discoverable.
- Overall, the app is intuitive for basic use, but feature depth might overwhelm first-time users.
