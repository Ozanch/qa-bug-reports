# General Feedback – The QA Boy by Roquen_Pale

I tested the Windows build of *The QA Boy* on Unity engine. The game launched properly and remained stable throughout my session.

### 🕹️ Controls
The core movement system (WASD + Space for jumping) and environmental interaction (E key) worked consistently. However, the movement has acceleration, which makes the controls feel slightly floaty and imprecise — something to consider adjusting for better player feedback.

### 🧱 Bugs & Issues
- One statue appears to be non-interactable — pressing E yields no response.
- There is a specific area on the map where the player can jump out of bounds and freely walk through buildings due to missing collision zones. *(You can attach a screenshot if needed.)*

### ✅ Summary
The overall structure is clear, and most features work as intended. The game can be improved with some collision fixes and polish around interactions. The concept is functional and could serve as a strong base for a short narrative or exploration experience.

Thanks for sharing the project!
