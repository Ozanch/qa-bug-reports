# General Feedback – PLAYTESTER by LilyDynamite

I completed a full test playthrough of the game. All three minigames worked smoothly, and the core mechanics functioned as intended. Controls were responsive, transitions were clean, and no technical issues were encountered during the session.

Since this is a short prototype, there aren’t many features that need changing but here’s one small suggestion that could improve the experience:

### 🛠️ Suggestion

- **Volume Control:**  
  A basic volume slider would be helpful for players who want to adjust the game’s audio without muting their entire browser or system.

Overall, the game feels good and fun for a short experience. Great job!
